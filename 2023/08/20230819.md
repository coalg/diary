「自然な証明」について。

> That paper, by the complexity theorists Alexander Razborov and Steven Rudich, had shown that a certain “natural” strategy for proving P ≠ NP would almost certainly fail, because success would come at a steep cost — the complete breakdown of cryptography — that researchers regarded as very unlikely.

> This “natural proofs barrier” is just one of many known barriers to solving open problems in complexity theory. Each acts like a roadblock, warning that a seemingly promising path is actually a dead end. Together, these barriers indicate that any proof that resolves the P versus NP problem would have to be radically different than anything used in the past; that’s why most researchers believe a solution remains far off. But at least barriers tell them where not to look.

> “Complexity theory is both cursed and blessed with so many barriers,” Ilango said.
